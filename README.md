# clicker-game

This is a simple clicker/idle game I'm building as a hobby project to learn game development with the Godot Engine. I'm also using this as a hands-on way to practice coding, object-oriented programming, and general software development concepts.

gameplay:
You click a button, earn points/cookies, and eventually unlock upgrades or automation to increase how much you earn. Think Cookie Clicker, but stripped down to its basics.

Right now, the project is focused on:

    Learning how to structure projects in Godot

    Implementing clean and modular code using object-oriented programming

    Experimenting with UI design and game feel

Eventually, I might add things like:

    Upgrades

    Offline progression

    Save/load system

    Custom art and sound 

Why this project?

I wanted something small enough to manage alone, but flexible enough to grow with my skills. Clicker games are perfect for that. Thereâ€™s a surprising amount of systems to build even in a simple idle game, which makes it a great sandbox for learning how everything fits together.
Current Status

Still early in development. Expect rough edges with half-finished features. I'm learning as I go.
